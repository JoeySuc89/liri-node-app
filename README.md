# liri-node-app

Welcome to my Liri-Node-App. Everythong gets done in the node console.

Here we take a few commands to look up information on a few topics.

We use the spotify API to look up songs and retrieve some of that song nformation. To make it work in LIRI Bot we simply type: "node liri.js spotify-this-song <name of song here>.

I also used the Bands in Town API where we can type in bands that are currently touring to get the venue info and the touring dates. We type the command:
"node liri.js conert-this <band name here>

Then there was the OMDB API where we pull in information about movies. That command looks like:
"node liri.js movie-this <movie name here>

You can also tell LIRI to do what it says and It will randomly pull in a command from a different file connected with the liri.js file.

Here you can view how the app works:
